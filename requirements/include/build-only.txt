# These are only used when building the wheelhouse.  Since our deployment scenarios only use
# packages from the wheelhouse, as long as we get the right versions in there, the
# other requirements files don't need to care about where the packages come from, only that they
# are installed.  There should be symmetry between this file and install-only.txt.
